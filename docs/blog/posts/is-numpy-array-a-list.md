# Is a NumPy array a list?

<!-- more -->

!!! info "In short"
    Nope. NumPy arrays are a completely different beast, even though they look similar. Arrays are fixed-type (all elements must be the same, like all floats), while lists accept mixed types. Arrays support vectorized math—`array * 2` multiplies every element, but `list * 2` just repeats the list. Arrays are 10-100x faster for numeric work and use way less memory. Convert between them with `list(array)` or `np.array(list)`. Use arrays for math, science, and data work. Use lists for general Python programming. They're cousins, not twins.

Let me show you the key differences:

```python
import numpy as np

# Python list
py_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# py_list * 2  # Would give [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# NumPy array
np_array = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
doubled = np_array * 2  # Vectorized operation
print(doubled)

# Different types
print(f"List: {type(py_list)}")
print(f"Array: {type(np_array)}")
print(f"Array dtype: {np_array.dtype}")

# Convert back
back_to_list = list(np_array)
print(back_to_list)
```

Running this code, the NumPy multiplication gives `[ 2  4  6  8 10]`—each element doubled. The types show `<class 'list'>` vs `<class 'numpy.ndarray'>`. Converting back to a list produces `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

That vectorization is the magic. No loops needed, just `* 2` and done.

## Gotchas

* **Type homogeneity** — `np.array([1, 2.5])` converts everything to float. Lists happily mix types. Arrays sacrifice flexibility for speed.
* **Different indexing** — NumPy supports fancy indexing like `array[array > 5]` (boolean masks). Lists don't do that.
* **Memory layout** — arrays are packed tightly in memory (cache-friendly), lists store pointers to scattered Python objects. That's why arrays are so much faster for math.
