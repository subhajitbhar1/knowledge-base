# What are the three types of lists in Python?

<!-- more -->

!!! info "In short"
    Here's the thing: Python doesn't actually have three different "types" of lists. There's just one—the `list` type. What the question probably means is the three main *ways to create* lists. You can write them literally with square brackets, use the `list()` constructor to convert other stuff, or generate them with list comprehensions. All three give you the exact same kind of object. Some people also talk about nested lists vs flat lists, but that's about content, not type. Bottom line: one list type, multiple ways to make it.

Let me show you all three creation methods:

```python
# 1. Literal syntax
list1 = [1, 2, 3]

# 2. list() constructor
list2 = list(range(1, 4))

# 3. List comprehension
list3 = [x for x in range(1, 4)]

print(list1 == list2 == list3)  # All identical
print(type(list1))
```

Running this code proves they're all the same. The output shows `True` (they're equal) and `<class 'list'>` for the type. They all produce identical results—the syntax changes, but the type doesn't.

They all produce identical results. The syntax changes, but the type doesn't. Choose based on readability and what you're doing.

## Gotchas

* **No official "three types"** — if someone insists there are three types of lists, they're probably confused. It's one type, different creation patterns. Or they might mean list/tuple/range, which are different data types entirely.
* **List comprehensions aren't a type** — they're just syntactic sugar for building lists. Under the hood, Python creates a regular old list object. The comprehension is gone once the list exists.
* **Don't overthink it** — at runtime, Python doesn't care how you made the list. `[1, 2, 3]` and `list([1, 2, 3])` are functionally identical. Pick what reads best.
