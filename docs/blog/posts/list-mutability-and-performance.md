# How does list mutability affect performance?

<!-- more -->

!!! info "In short"
    Mutability enables fast in-place operations—`.append()`, `.sort()`, `.reverse()` modify directly without copying, saving time and memory. But it's a double-edged sword. When functions might modify shared lists, you end up making defensive copies (`list.copy()`), which negates the speed benefit. Lists over-allocate memory for growth, using more RAM than tuples. For read-only data, tuples are lighter and enable optimizations. The trade-off: mutability gives you efficient modifications but at the cost of higher memory use and potential hidden copies when you need safety.

Let me show you the trade-offs:

```python
import sys

# In-place modification (efficient)
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
numbers.reverse()  # O(n), no new list
print(numbers)

# Memory comparison
list_obj = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
tuple_obj = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
print(f"List: {sys.getsizeof(list_obj)} bytes")
print(f"Tuple: {sys.getsizeof(tuple_obj)} bytes")

# Defensive copy cost
def process(items):
    safe = items.copy()  # Extra work due to mutability
    safe.sort()
    return safe

result = process([3, 1, 2])
print(result)
```

In the code above, reversing the list happens instantly in-place: `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`. The memory check shows lists use 104 bytes vs tuples at 88 bytes—that's the cost of flexibility. The function makes a defensive copy to avoid surprising mutations.

That 16-byte difference is the cost of flexibility—over-allocation for future growth.

## Gotchas

* **Hidden copies everywhere** — good defensive programming means copying mutable arguments. So you end up copying anyway, losing the modification speed benefit.
* **Over-allocation compounds** — lists pre-allocate ~12% extra space. For millions of small lists, that's real memory waste. Consider tuples or arrays for fixed data.
* **Shared state bugs** — `list2 = list1` creates a reference. Modify one, both change. This forces more copies than you'd need with immutable structures.
