# How do you access elements in a Python list?
<!-- more -->

!!! info "In short"
    Square brackets with the position: `my_list[0]` gets the first item. Python counts from zero, so `[0]` is first, `[1]` is second, and so on. Negative numbers count backwards: `[-1]` is last, `[-2]` is second-to-last. Try to access something that doesn't exist and you'll get an `IndexError`. To be safe, check the length first or use slicing (which doesn't crash on bad indices). It's simple once you remember: zero is the beginning, negatives work backwards from the end.

## Example (runnable)

```python
# Basic indexing
<!-- more -->
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]

print(fruits[0])    # First element
print(fruits[2])    # Third element
print(fruits[-1])   # Last element
print(fruits[-2])   # Second to last

# Length check before accessing
<!-- more -->
if len(fruits) > 3:
    print(fruits[3])
```

**Expected output:**
```
apple
cherry
date
cherry
date
```

That negative indexing is genuinely handy—no need to calculate `len(list) - 1` for the last item.

## Gotchas

* **Zero-based indexing** — this is the classic beginner stumble. The first item is `[0]`, not `[1]`. Coming from math or Excel, it feels wrong. You'll adjust.
* **IndexError is common** — accessing `list[5]` when there are only 3 items crashes hard. Always validate if you're unsure, or use try/except if you're feeling defensive.
* **Negative indices aren't magic** — `list[-100]` on a 3-item list still raises IndexError. Negatives just mean "count from the end", they don't wrap around infinitely or anything clever.
