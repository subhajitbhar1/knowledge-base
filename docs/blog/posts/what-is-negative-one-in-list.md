# What is [-1] in a Python list?
<!-- more -->

!!! info "In short"
    `[-1]` grabs the last item in the list. Simple as that. Negative indices count from the end: `-1` is last, `-2` is second-to-last, and so on. It's way cleaner than writing `list[len(list) - 1]` every time you need the last element. Works on any sequence—lists, tuples, strings, whatever. Empty list? You'll get an `IndexError`, same as with regular indices. But for non-empty lists, `[-1]` is your quick shortcut to "give me the last thing."

## Example (runnable)

```python
# Negative indexing
<!-- more -->
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

print(numbers[-1])   # Last element
print(numbers[-2])   # Second to last
print(numbers[-5])   # First element (same as [0])

# Works on strings too
<!-- more -->
text = "Hello"
print(text[-1])      

# Last element without knowing length
<!-- more -->
last = numbers[-1]
print(f"Last: {last}")
```

**Expected output:**
```
50
40
10
o
Last: 50
```

Notice `-5` gets you the first element. Count backwards from the end: -1, -2, -3, -4, -5.

## Gotchas

* **Empty list crashes** — `[][-1]` raises IndexError. There's no last element to grab. If you're unsure the list has items, check `if my_list:` first or use slicing: `my_list[-1:]` returns `[]` safely.
* **Still out-of-bounds errors** — `list[-1000]` on a small list crashes. Negative indexing doesn't magically protect you from bad indices, it just changes which direction you're counting.
* **Slicing vs indexing** — in slices, `list[:-1]` means "everything *except* the last element." That's different from accessing `list[-1]`. Takes a moment to internalize.
