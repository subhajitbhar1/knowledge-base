# What is the purpose of using a list in Python?

<!-- more -->

!!! info "In short"
    Lists exist to hold multiple things in one place without juggling separate variables. Need to collect results from a loop? List. Processing a batch of user inputs? List. Building a queue or tracking history? List. They shine when you need ordered storage that can grow or shrink on the fly. You don't have to know upfront how many items you'll have—just start with an empty list and append as you go. Think of them as your default "bunch of stuff" container when the order matters and things might change.

Here's a typical use case—collecting results as you process data:

```python
# Collect results from a loop
squares = []
for i in range(1, 6):
    squares.append(i ** 2)
print(squares)

# Process items in order
scores = [85, 92, 78, 90]
average = sum(scores) / len(scores)
print(f"Average: {average}")
```

In the above example, we start with an empty list and build it up during the loop, ending with `[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]`. Then we process a batch of scores to calculate an average. Lists make both patterns simple and readable.

The trick is knowing when *not* to use a list. If you're constantly searching for specific items, you probably want a dictionary or set instead.

## Gotchas

* **Not your hammer for every nail** — if you find yourself doing `[x for x in list if x.id == target_id]`, stop. Use a dictionary with IDs as keys. Lists are O(n) for lookups, which hurts fast.
* **Memory overhead exists** — lists pre-allocate extra space to grow efficiently. For millions of tiny lists, that adds up. Consider alternatives like generators or NumPy arrays for huge numeric datasets.
* **Don't fake other data structures** — yes, you *can* use a list as a queue by popping index 0. But `collections.deque` exists for a reason—it's way faster for that pattern.
