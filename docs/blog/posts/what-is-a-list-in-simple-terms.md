# What is a list in simple terms?

<!-- more -->

!!! info "In short"
    Imagine a shopping list or a to-do list. That's basically what a Python list is—a container that holds items in order. You write it with square brackets, items separated by commas. Unlike a paper list though, you can easily add new things, cross items off, or change what's written. Python remembers the exact order, and you can grab any item by counting from the top (starting at 0, because programmers like to be difficult). That's it. Simple, flexible, and everywhere in Python code.

Here's a quick example to see lists in action:

```python
# A simple shopping list
shopping = ["milk", "bread", "eggs"]

# Check what's first
print(shopping[0])

# Add an item
shopping.append("butter")

# See the whole list
print(shopping)
```

In the code above, `shopping[0]` gives us "milk" (remember, counting starts at 0). Then we append "butter" to the end, and the final print shows all four items: `['milk', 'bread', 'eggs', 'butter']`.

The weird part? Counting starts at zero. So `shopping[0]` gives you "milk", not `shopping[1]`. Everyone stumbles on this at first. You'll get used to it.

## Gotchas

* **Zero means first** — `list[0]` is the first item, `list[1]` is the second. This feels backwards until it clicks. Just remember: Python counts like elevator buttons in some European buildings.
* **Lists remember order** — unlike some other data structures, lists always keep things in the exact sequence you added them. That's the whole point.
* **You can mix types** — throw in numbers, words, even other lists. Python won't complain. But just because you *can* doesn't mean you *should*—mixed-type lists can make your code confusing.
