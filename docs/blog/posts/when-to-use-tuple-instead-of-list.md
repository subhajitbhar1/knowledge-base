# When would you use a tuple instead of a list?

<!-- more -->

!!! info "In short"
    Use tuples when the data shouldn't change—coordinates like (x, y), RGB colors, function returns with multiple values, or database rows. Tuples say "this structure is fixed" to anyone reading your code. They can be dict keys and set members (because they're hashable); lists can't. Tuples are a hair faster and lighter on memory, but that's rarely the deciding factor. Choose tuples when immutability is the point—either for safety (preventing accidental changes) or because you need hashability. If you catch yourself wanting to modify items, you probably need a list.

Here's when tuples shine:

```python
# Tuple: fixed structure
point = (10, 20)  # x, y coordinates
rgb = (255, 128, 0)

# Can use as dict key
locations = {
    (0, 0): "origin",
    (10, 20): "point A"
}
print(locations[point])

# Tuple unpacking
x, y = point
print(f"X: {x}, Y: {y}")

# List: mutable collection
scores = [85, 92, 78]
scores.append(90)  # Can modify
print(scores)
```

In the above code, the tuple `(10, 20)` works as a dict key, which lists can't do. We unpack it cleanly into `x` and `y` variables. Meanwhile, the list accepts new items freely.

That dict key usage is huge—you can't do that with lists. Tuples unlock whole patterns.

## Gotchas

* **Not fully immutable** — if your tuple contains a list, you can modify that list. The tuple's *structure* is frozen, but mutable contents inside aren't magically protected.
* **Single-item tuple needs comma** — `(1)` is just an int in parens. Write `(1,)` for a one-item tuple. This bites everyone once, then you remember forever.
* **Performance is minor** — tuples are faster, but for small data it's imperceptible. Choose for semantics ("this shouldn't change") not micro-optimization.
