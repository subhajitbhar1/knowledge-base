# When should you use a Python list?
<!-- more -->

!!! info "In short"
    Use a list when you need ordered items that might change, and you're mainly accessing them by position or looping through everything. Collecting results in a loop? List. Processing items one by one? List. Building a stack (append/pop from end)? List. They're your default for "I need to store multiple things in order." But skip lists if you're constantly checking whether items exist (use a set), looking things up by name or ID (use a dict), or the data shouldn't change (use a tuple). When in doubt, start with a list—it's rarely wrong.

## Example (runnable)

```python
# Good use case: collecting results
<!-- more -->
results = []
for i in range(5):
    results.append(i ** 2)
print(results)

# Good: maintaining order
<!-- more -->
queue = ["first", "second", "third"]
current = queue.pop(0)
print(f"Processing: {current}")

# Bad pattern: frequent lookups (use set instead)
<!-- more -->
# if item in huge_list:  # This is slow!

# Better for lookups
<!-- more -->
seen = set()
seen.add("item")
print("item" in seen)  # Fast!
```

**Expected output:**
```
[0, 1, 4, 9, 16]
Processing: first
True
```

See how lists shine for sequential operations but struggle with lookups?

## Gotchas

* **Not for "does it contain X" checks** — running `if x in list` scans every item. For big collections you search frequently, sets are 100x faster.
* **Not your universal storage** — if you're looking up by ID, name, or key, dictionaries are the answer. Lists are for "item 0, item 1, item 2" access patterns.
* **Not for immutable data** — if the data shouldn't change, use a tuple. It signals intent and prevents accidents. Plus tuples can be dict keys; lists can't.
