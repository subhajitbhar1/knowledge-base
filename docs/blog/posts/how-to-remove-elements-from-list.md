# How do I remove elements from a Python list?

<!-- more -->

!!! info "In short"
    `.remove(value)` finds and deletes the first matching item (crashes if not found). `.pop(index)` removes by position and hands you the item back (defaults to last if no index given). `del list[index]` or `del list[start:end]` nukes items by position or slice. `.clear()` empties the whole list. For removing items based on conditions, list comprehensions are cleaner: `[x for x in list if x != unwanted]`. Just remember: remove and pop change the list in-place, comprehensions give you a new one.

Here are the main removal techniques:

```python
# Remove by value
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "banana"]
fruits.remove("banana")  # Removes first occurrence
print(fruits)

# Pop by index (returns the item)
last = fruits.pop()
print(f"Removed: {last}, Remaining: {fruits}")

# Delete by index or slice
numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
del numbers[0]
del numbers[1:3]
print(numbers)

# Filter with comprehension
evens = [x for x in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] if x % 2 == 0]
print(evens)
```

In the example above, `remove("banana")` only kills the first "banana", leaving us `['apple', 'cherry', 'banana']`. The `pop()` removes and returns "banana", so `last` gets that value. After the `del` operations, `numbers` becomes `[1, 4]`. And the comprehension builds a fresh list: `[2, 4]`.

Notice remove only got the first "banana"—the second one stayed.

## Gotchas

* **remove() only removes once** — got duplicates? It only kills the first match. To remove all, use a comprehension: `[x for x in list if x != target]`.
* **Never modify while iterating** — `for item in list: list.remove(item)` is a bug waiting to happen. The iterator gets confused as the list changes underneath it. Use comprehensions or iterate backwards with indices.
* **pop() without index takes the last** — `list.pop()` grabs from the end (stack behavior). Need the first? `list.pop(0)` works but is slow for big lists. Consider `collections.deque` if you're doing that a lot.
