# Is a list a data type in Python?

<!-- more -->

!!! info "In short"
    Yes, absolutely. List is a built-in data type in Python, just like integers and strings. The difference? Lists are what we call "compound" or "collection" types—they hold other things. When you ask Python `type([1, 2, 3])`, it tells you `<class 'list'>`. Lists belong to the sequence family, along with tuples and strings. Under the hood, they're dynamic arrays that can grow and shrink. So yes, a list is a first-class data type, and you'll use them constantly.

Let me show you how to check this yourself:

```python
# Check the type of a list
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
print(type(my_list))

# Verify it's an instance of list
print(isinstance(my_list, list))

# Compare with other types
print(type(42))        # int
print(type("text"))    # str
```

Running the above code confirms that lists are indeed a proper data type. The output shows `<class 'list'>`, and `isinstance` returns `True`. Notice how it's on equal footing with `int` and `str`—they're all built-in Python types.

What surprises people: lists are objects with methods like `.append()` and `.sort()`. They're not "primitive" like integers—they're richer, more powerful, but also a bit heavier.

## Gotchas

* **Lists are objects, not primitives** — this means they have methods you can call and they behave differently than simple numbers or booleans. They're more like little containers with their own behaviors.
* **Type checking matters** — when writing defensive code, use `isinstance(x, list)` instead of `type(x) == list`. It plays nicer with inheritance and subclasses.
* **Don't confuse with arrays** — Python lists aren't the same as C or Java arrays. Lists are more flexible (mixed types allowed) but potentially slower for massive numeric operations. For that, look at NumPy.
