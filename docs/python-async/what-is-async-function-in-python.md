# What is async function in Python?

<!-- more -->

!!! info "In short"
    An async function is a function defined with `async def` instead of just `def`. It's technically called a coroutine function, and when you call it, you get a coroutine object that must be awaited or run by an event loop. Async functions can use `await` to pause and let other tasks run while waiting for I/O. They're the building blocks of asynchronous programmingâ€”each one represents a task that can cooperate with others instead of blocking the whole program.

## Example

Here's a comparison between regular and async functions:

```python
import asyncio
import time

def sync_function():
    print("Sync: Starting")
    time.sleep(1)
    print("Sync: Done")
    return "Sync result"

async def async_function():
    print("Async: Starting")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print("Async: Done")
    return "Async result"

# Regular function - just call it
result1 = sync_function()
print(result1)

# Async function - need asyncio.run()
result2 = asyncio.run(async_function())
print(result2)
```

**Output:**
```
Sync: Starting
Sync: Done
Sync result
Async: Starting
Async: Done
Async result
```

The difference: `sync_function()` blocks everything while sleeping, but `async_function()` can let other tasks run during the sleep.

## Gotchas

- **Async functions aren't async all the way down**. If you call a blocking sync function inside an async function, you still block the event loop. Use async libraries like `aiohttp` instead of `requests`.
- **You can't await in a sync function**. Once you go async, everything that calls it needs to be async too (it's "contagious").
- **Async functions have overhead**. For simple, fast operations, they're slower than regular functions. Use them when you're actually waiting for I/O.
