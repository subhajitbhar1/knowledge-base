# Which is better threading or asyncio in Python?

<!-- more -->

!!! info "In short"
    Neither is universally "better"—it depends on your use case. **Choose asyncio for:** web servers, websockets, API-heavy apps, or 100+ concurrent I/O tasks. **Choose threading for:** quick parallelization of sync code, mixing CPU and I/O work, or when your libraries don't support async. **Choose multiprocessing for:** CPU-bound work. The deciding factors: scale (asyncio wins big), library ecosystem (threading works with everything), and code complexity (threading is simpler for beginners). If starting fresh with modern libraries, lean toward asyncio. If retrofitting existing code, threading is less disruptive.

Here's a decision matrix:

```python
# Use asyncio when:
# - Handling 100-10k concurrent connections
# - Working with async-native libraries (aiohttp, asyncpg)
# - Building web servers, chat apps, streaming services
# - Memory efficiency matters

import asyncio
import aiohttp

async def fetch_many(urls):
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        tasks = [session.get(url) for url in urls]
        responses = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
        return responses

# Use threading when:
# - Need 5-50 concurrent tasks max
# - Libraries are sync-only (requests, sqlite3)
# - Mixing I/O with CPU work
# - Team isn't familiar with async

import threading
import requests

def fetch_one(url):
    return requests.get(url).text

threads = []
for url in urls:
    t = threading.Thread(target=fetch_one, args=(url,))
    t.start()
    threads.append(t)

for t in threads:
    t.join()
```

**Performance at scale:**
- 10 tasks: Threading is simpler, similar speed
- 100 tasks: Asyncio starts winning
- 1000+ tasks: Asyncio is dramatically better

**Memory at 1000 tasks:**
- Threading: ~1-8 GB (1-8 MB per thread)
- Asyncio: ~10-50 MB (KB per task)

Here's the pragmatic answer: if you're building something new and modern, invest in learning asyncio—it's the future. If you need something working today with existing code, threading is faster to implement.

## Gotchas

* **Don't mix them carelessly** — running async code in threads or vice versa requires careful handling. Stick to one model per project if possible.
* **Debugging is harder with asyncio** — stack traces are more complex. Threading has better tooling support.
* **Library lock-in matters** — once you choose asyncio, you're committed to async libraries throughout. Threading works with everything.
