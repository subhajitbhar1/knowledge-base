# Is Python asynchronous?

<!-- more -->

!!! info "In short"
    Python isn't asynchronous by default—it's synchronous at its core. Code runs line by line, top to bottom. But Python supports asynchronous programming through `asyncio` and the `async`/`await` syntax (since Python 3.5). You opt into async when you need it. Think of it like a car: Python normally drives in one lane (sync), but you can enable features for lane-switching (async) when traffic (I/O waits) makes it worthwhile. Most Python code is still synchronous, and that's perfectly fine for most use cases.

Here's a comparison showing the difference:

```python
import time
import asyncio

# Synchronous Python (default)
def sync_task():
    print("Sync start")
    time.sleep(1)
    print("Sync done")

sync_task()  # Blocks for 1 second

# Asynchronous Python (opt-in)
async def async_task():
    print("Async start")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print("Async done")

asyncio.run(async_task())  # Can yield during sleep
```

Both take about 1 second, but the async version can let other tasks run during the `await asyncio.sleep(1)`. Synchronous Python waits; asynchronous Python cooperates.

Here's what people often miss: Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) means only one thread executes Python bytecode at a time. Async isn't about parallelism—it's about concurrency. You're not doing more work at once, just switching between waiting tasks efficiently.

## Gotchas

* **Async is opt-in, not automatic** — just importing `asyncio` doesn't make your code async. You need `async def` and `await` explicitly.
* **Libraries must support async** — using `requests` in async code still blocks. You need async-compatible libraries like `aiohttp` or `httpx`.
* **Mixing sync and async is tricky** — calling sync blocking code from async functions defeats the purpose. Use `asyncio.to_thread()` for unavoidable sync calls.
