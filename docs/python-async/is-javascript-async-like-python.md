# Is JavaScript async like Python?

<!-- more -->

!!! info "In short"
    JavaScript and Python async look similar (`async`/`await` keywords in both), but the underlying models differ. JavaScript is async by default—nearly everything returns a Promise. Python is sync by default—you opt into async explicitly. JavaScript has a built-in event loop that's always running. Python's event loop (asyncio) must be started manually with `asyncio.run()`. Both use cooperative multitasking, but JavaScript feels more "async native" while Python treats it as an add-on. If you know JS async, Python async will feel familiar syntactically but require adjusting your mental model about when things are async.

Here's a side-by-side comparison:

```javascript
// JavaScript (async by default)
async function fetchData() {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
    const data = await response.json();
    return data;
}

// Just call it - event loop always runs
fetchData().then(data => console.log(data));
```

```python
# Python (sync by default, opt-in async)
import asyncio
import aiohttp

async def fetch_data():
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        async with session.get('https://api.example.com/data') as response:
            data = await response.json()
            return data

# Must explicitly run the event loop
asyncio.run(fetch_data())
```

Both use `async`/`await`, but JavaScript's event loop runs automatically in the browser or Node.js. Python requires you to start the loop explicitly.

Key difference: JavaScript's `setTimeout()`, fetch, and most I/O are async by default. Python's equivalents (`time.sleep()`, `requests`) are sync—you need async versions (`asyncio.sleep()`, `aiohttp`).

Here's what surprises JS developers in Python: you can't just `await` anything. The function and all its dependencies must be explicitly async. JavaScript is more permissive.

## Gotchas

* **Different event loop lifecycle** — JS event loop runs continuously, Python's must be started/stopped. You can't nest `asyncio.run()` calls.
* **Library differences** — JS has Promise-based APIs everywhere. Python requires finding async-compatible libraries.
* **Error handling differs** — JS uses Promise rejection, Python uses exceptions. Both work in try/catch (or try/except), but the propagation differs slightly.
