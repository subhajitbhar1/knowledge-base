# Why use async in Python?

<!-- more -->

!!! info "In short"
    Use async when you're spending lots of time waiting—for APIs, databases, file I/O, or network requests. Async lets you handle thousands of concurrent connections with minimal memory, making it perfect for web servers, chat apps, or data pipelines that call many APIs. The win: while one request waits for a response, others can progress. For CPU-bound work (calculations, data processing), async doesn't help—use multiprocessing instead. The trade-off: async adds complexity, so only reach for it when I/O waits are your bottleneck. If your program spends <50% of its time waiting, stick with sync code.

Here's a dramatic comparison showing async's power:

```python
import asyncio
import time

# Synchronous version
def sync_fetch_all():
    start = time.time()
    for i in range(10):
        time.sleep(0.5)  # Simulates API call
    print(f"Sync: {time.time() - start:.2f}s")  # ~5 seconds

sync_fetch_all()

# Async version
async def async_fetch(n):
    await asyncio.sleep(0.5)

async def async_fetch_all():
    start = time.time()
    await asyncio.gather(*[async_fetch(i) for i in range(10)])
    print(f"Async: {time.time() - start:.2f}s")  # ~0.5 seconds

asyncio.run(async_fetch_all())
```

The async version is 10x faster because all 10 "API calls" run concurrently. Sync waits for each one sequentially.

Real-world win: a web scraper that fetches 1000 pages. Sync takes 1000 × 0.5s = 500s. Async with 100 concurrent tasks takes ~5s. That's a 100x speedup with the same hardware.

Here's when NOT to use async: simple scripts, CPU-heavy computations, or when you're already using fast sync libraries. The debugging pain isn't worth it unless you're I/O-bound.

## Gotchas

* **Async adds complexity** — your code gets harder to read, debug, and test. Only use it when the performance gain justifies the cost.
* **Library ecosystem matters** — if your dependencies don't support async, you're forced to use slow workarounds. Check library support first.
* **Scaling has limits** — async handles 10k concurrent connections great, but each connection still consumes memory. Beyond ~50k, you need specialized tools.
