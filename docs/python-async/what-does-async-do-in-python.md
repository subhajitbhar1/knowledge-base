# What does async do in Python?

<!-- more -->

!!! info "In short"
    The `async` keyword transforms a regular function into a coroutineâ€”a special type of function that can pause its execution with `await` and let other code run. It doesn't run the function in the background or make it parallel; instead, it makes the function cooperative, allowing it to voluntarily yield control. When you call an async function, it returns a coroutine object that needs to be awaited or run by an event loop. It's the foundation for Python's cooperative multitasking model.

## Example

Here's what happens when you use `async`:

```python
import asyncio

async def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print(f"Goodbye, {name}!")
    return f"{name} greeted"

# Calling it directly returns a coroutine object
coro = greet("Alice")
print(coro)  # <coroutine object greet at 0x...>

# You need to await it or run it with asyncio.run()
result = asyncio.run(greet("Bob"))
print(result)
```

**Output:**
```
<coroutine object greet at 0x...>
Hello, Bob!
Goodbye, Bob!
Bob greeted
```

The `async` keyword makes `greet()` return a coroutine instead of executing immediately. You must await it or use `asyncio.run()` to actually run it.

## Gotchas

- **Forgetting to await gives you a coroutine object, not the result**. Python 3.7+ will warn you: "coroutine 'greet' was never awaited."
- **async alone doesn't make code concurrent**. You need to use `await asyncio.gather()` or `asyncio.create_task()` to run multiple coroutines concurrently.
- **You can't use await outside async functions**. Trying to call `await` in regular functions gives a SyntaxError.
