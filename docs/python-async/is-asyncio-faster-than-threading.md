# Is asyncio faster than threading?

<!-- more -->

!!! info "In short"
    For I/O-bound tasks, asyncio is usually faster and more scalable than threading. Asyncio has lower overhead (no thread creation cost), uses less memory (one event loop vs many threads), and scales better (10k+ concurrent tasks). Threading excels when you need to mix sync and async code or when using libraries that release the GIL (like NumPy). For CPU-bound work, neither helps—both are limited by Python's GIL. Use multiprocessing instead. The practical rule: for modern async-first I/O code, choose asyncio. For existing sync code with occasional concurrency, threading is easier.

Here's a performance comparison:

```python
import asyncio
import threading
import time

# Test: 1000 "network requests" (simulated with sleep)

# Threading approach
def thread_task():
    time.sleep(0.001)

def threading_test():
    start = time.time()
    threads = []
    for _ in range(1000):
        t = threading.Thread(target=thread_task)
        t.start()
        threads.append(t)
    for t in threads:
        t.join()
    print(f"Threading: {time.time() - start:.2f}s")

# Asyncio approach
async def async_task():
    await asyncio.sleep(0.001)

async def asyncio_test():
    start = time.time()
    await asyncio.gather(*[async_task() for _ in range(1000)])
    print(f"Asyncio: {time.time() - start:.2f}s")

threading_test()  # ~1-2 seconds (thread overhead)
asyncio.run(asyncio_test())  # ~0.01 seconds (minimal overhead)
```

Asyncio wins dramatically for many small I/O tasks. Thread creation and context switching add significant overhead.

Memory usage: 1000 threads ≈ 1-8 MB per thread = 1-8 GB. 1000 asyncio tasks ≈ a few KB each = a few MB total. Asyncio is 100-1000x more memory efficient.

Here's the nuance: for 10-50 tasks, threading is simpler and fast enough. At 100+ concurrent tasks, asyncio's benefits become obvious.

## Gotchas

* **Asyncio requires async libraries** — if your libraries are sync-only, threading might be easier despite being slower.
* **Threading is better for mixed workloads** — if you have both CPU and I/O work, threads can handle both (though not optimally). Asyncio only helps with I/O.
* **Startup time differs** — asyncio has one-time loop startup cost. For short-lived scripts with few tasks, threading might finish first.
