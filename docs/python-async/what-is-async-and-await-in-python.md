# What is async and await in Python?

<!-- more -->

!!! info "In short"
    `async` and `await` are two keywords that work together to enable cooperative multitasking. `async` marks a function as asynchronous (a coroutine), and `await` is used inside that function to pause execution while waiting for another async operation to complete. Think of `async` as "this function can take breaks" and `await` as "take a break here." While one task is waiting, the event loop can run other tasks. They're Python's answer to non-blocking I/O without the complexity of threads or callbacks.

## Example

Here's how they work together:

```python
import asyncio

async def make_coffee():
    print("Grinding beans...")
    await asyncio.sleep(2)  # Pause here - let other tasks run
    print("Coffee ready!")
    return "Coffee"

async def make_toast():
    print("Toasting bread...")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Another pause point
    print("Toast ready!")
    return "Toast"

async def make_breakfast():
    # Run both concurrently
    coffee, toast = await asyncio.gather(
        make_coffee(),
        make_toast()
    )
    print(f"Breakfast: {coffee} and {toast}")

asyncio.run(make_breakfast())
```

**Output:**
```
Grinding beans...
Toasting bread...
Toast ready!
Coffee ready!
Breakfast: Coffee and Toast
```

Toast finishes first even though coffee started firstâ€”that's cooperative multitasking. Each `await` is a yield point where control can switch.

## Gotchas

- **await only works inside async functions**. Using it in regular functions gives `SyntaxError: 'await' outside async function`.
- **Not everything is awaitable**. You can only await coroutines, tasks, and futures. Regular functions or objects will give a TypeError.
- **Forgetting await on an async call** means you get a coroutine object, not the result. Python will warn you: "coroutine was never awaited."
