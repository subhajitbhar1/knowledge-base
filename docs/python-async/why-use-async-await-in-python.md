# Why use async await in Python?

<!-- more -->

!!! info "In short"
    Async/await makes asynchronous code look like synchronous code, which is way easier to read and maintain than callbacks or raw coroutines. Before async/await, you had nested callbacks ("callback hell") or complex generator-based coroutines. Now you write straightforward sequential-looking code that's actually concurrent. The syntax makes control flow obvious—no more guessing where execution goes next. Use async/await when you need async I/O but want your code to remain readable. It's Python's answer to JavaScript's Promise hell, and it works beautifully for web servers, API clients, and any I/O-heavy application.

Here's why async/await is better than alternatives:

```python
import asyncio

# Old way: callbacks (messy, hard to follow)
def fetch_old(callback):
    def inner():
        # Fetch data...
        callback(data)
    # Complex callback chaining

# async/await way: clean and sequential
async def fetch_user(user_id):
    user = await get_user_from_db(user_id)
    posts = await get_posts_for_user(user_id)
    comments = await get_comments_for_posts(posts)
    return {"user": user, "posts": posts, "comments": comments}
```

The async/await version reads top-to-bottom like sync code, but it's fully asynchronous. No callback nesting, no loss of context. Each `await` is a clear "wait here" marker.

Here's the insight: async/await doesn't change what you can do (you could do async before Python 3.5), but it makes it dramatically more pleasant. Code that was previously cryptic becomes maintainable.

## Gotchas

* **Still need to learn the event loop** — async/await is syntactic sugar. You still need to understand how asyncio works underneath.
* **Infectious by design** — once you go async, all callers need to be async too. You can't easily mix sync and async without adapting.
* **Not a magic bullet** — async/await doesn't make slow I/O fast. It just lets you do other things while waiting. If your I/O is slow, it's still slow.
