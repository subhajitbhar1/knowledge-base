# Can Python be multithreaded?

<!-- more -->

!!! info "In short"
    Yes, Python can be multithreaded using the `threading` module. You can create and run multiple threads easily. However, the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) means only one thread executes Python bytecode at a time, so threads won't give you true parallelism for CPU-intensive work. Threads shine for I/O-bound tasks—downloading files, making API calls, reading from disk—because the GIL releases during I/O waits, letting other threads work. If you need real parallel computation, use `multiprocessing` instead.

Here's a practical example of multithreading for I/O:

```python
import threading
import time

def download_file(file_id):
    print(f"Downloading {file_id}...")
    time.sleep(2)  # Simulates I/O wait
    print(f"Downloaded {file_id}")

# Sequential approach
start = time.time()
for i in range(3):
    download_file(i)
print(f"Sequential: {time.time() - start:.2f}s")  # ~6 seconds

# Threaded approach
start = time.time()
threads = []
for i in range(3):
    t = threading.Thread(target=download_file, args=(i,))
    t.start()
    threads.append(t)

for t in threads:
    t.join()
print(f"Threaded: {time.time() - start:.2f}s")  # ~2 seconds
```

The threaded version is 3x faster because all downloads wait simultaneously. The GIL doesn't matter here—threads are just waiting for I/O, not computing.

Here's the catch: if your threads do heavy computation, the GIL forces them to take turns, and you gain nothing. Threading is for waiting, not calculating.

## Gotchas

* **Threading ≠ parallelism** — due to the GIL, threads don't run simultaneously for CPU work. They're concurrent (interleaved), not parallel.
* **Race conditions still exist** — even with the GIL, you can have bugs when threads modify shared data. Use `threading.Lock()` to protect shared resources.
* **Thread overhead adds up** — creating thousands of threads is expensive. For high concurrency, consider `asyncio` or a thread pool (`concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`).
