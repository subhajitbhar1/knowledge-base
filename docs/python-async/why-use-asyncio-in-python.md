# Why use asyncio in Python?

<!-- more -->

!!! info "In short"
    Use asyncio when you need to handle many I/O operations concurrently with minimal resource usage. It's lighter than threads (no overhead per task), more efficient than multiprocessing (no process spawning), and cleaner than callbacks. Perfect for web servers, websockets, database query batching, or scraping hundreds of websites. The sweet spot: 100-10,000 concurrent I/O operations. Below 100, regular sync code is simpler. Above 10k, you might need specialized tools. Asyncio gives you predictable, cooperative multitasking without the complexity of thread synchronization or the memory cost of processes.

Here's when asyncio shines:

```python
import asyncio
import aiohttp

# Fetch 100 URLs concurrently with minimal memory
async def fetch_all_urls(urls):
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        tasks = []
        for url in urls:
            tasks.append(fetch_url(session, url))
        
        # All requests run concurrently
        results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
        return results

async def fetch_url(session, url):
    async with session.get(url) as response:
        return await response.text()

# 100 requests, one event loop, minimal overhead
urls = [f"https://example.com/page/{i}" for i in range(100)]
asyncio.run(fetch_all_urls(urls))
```

With threads, you'd need 100 threads (expensive). With multiprocessing, 100 processes (very expensive). Asyncio handles all 100 with one thread and minimal memory.

Real-world example: a chat server handling 10,000 connected users. Asyncio can manage all connections in one process. Threads would need 10,000 threads (too many), and multiprocessing is overkill.

Here's the decision tree: CPU-bound? Use multiprocessing. A few I/O tasks? Use threads or stay sync. Hundreds/thousands of I/O tasks? Use asyncio.

## Gotchas

* **Learning curve is steep** — asyncio's mental model is different from sync code. Budget time for learning.
* **Ecosystem fragmentation** — not all libraries support asyncio. You might need to find async alternatives or write wrappers.
* **One blocking call ruins everything** — a single `time.sleep()` or sync database call blocks the entire event loop. Vigilance required.
