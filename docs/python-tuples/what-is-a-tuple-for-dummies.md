# What is a tuple for dummies?

<!-- more -->

!!! info "In short"
    Think of a tuple as a sealed envelope. You can put things in when you create it, but once it's sealed, nobody can add, remove, or swap what's inside. You can look at what's in there, count the items, even copy the whole envelope—but the contents stay fixed. In Python, you write tuples with parentheses: `(1, 2, 3)`. Lists use square brackets `[1, 2, 3]` and you can change them anytime. Tuples? Nope. That permanence is useful when you want to make sure data doesn't accidentally get modified. Perfect for coordinates, database rows, or returning multiple values from a function.

A tuple is just a container that holds multiple items in order, but you can't change it after you create it.

Imagine a train with cars. You can see what's in each car, you can walk through them in order, but you can't add cars, remove cars, or swap passengers between them. That's a tuple.

Here's a simple example to see the difference:

```python
# List - you CAN change it
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list.append(4)  # Works fine
print(my_list)  # [1, 2, 3, 4]

# Tuple - you CANNOT change it
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
try:
    my_tuple.append(4)  # This will fail
except AttributeError as e:
    print(f"Nope: {e}")
```

The list happily accepts a new item. The tuple doesn't even have an `append` method—it's not built for changes.

That's the whole story: tuples are read-only sequences. Simple as that.

## Gotchas

* **Creating single-item tuples** — `(5)` is just the number 5. Write `(5,)` with a comma to make it a tuple. Weird but true.
* **Tuples are still sequences** — you can loop through them, access by index `my_tuple[0]`, slice them `my_tuple[1:3]`. Just can't modify.
* **Why use them?** — They're faster, safer (no accidental changes), and you can use them as dictionary keys. Lists can't do that.
