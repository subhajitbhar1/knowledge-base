# What are the advantages of a tuple over a list?

<!-- more -->

!!! info "In short"
    Tuples are faster to create and iterate, use ~15-20% less memory, and are hashable (usable as dict keys/set members). But the real advantage is semantic: tuples signal "this data is fixed." That prevents bugs from accidental modifications. When you see a tuple in code, you know it won't change—it's a contract. Lists say "working collection, modify freely." Tuples say "structure is final." Use tuples for coordinates, function returns, database rows, or any fixed-size data. The immutability protection is worth more than the minor performance gains.

Tuples offer performance, memory, and safety advantages.

But the biggest win is communicating intent: this shouldn't change.

In the following example, we compare creation speed and use cases:

```python
import sys
import timeit

# Memory comparison
t = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
l = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(f"Tuple size: {sys.getsizeof(t)} bytes")
print(f"List size: {sys.getsizeof(l)} bytes")

# Speed comparison (creation)
tuple_time = timeit.timeit("(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)", number=1000000)
list_time = timeit.timeit("[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]", number=1000000)
print(f"\nTuple creation: {tuple_time:.4f}s")
print(f"List creation: {list_time:.4f}s")

# Hashability (main advantage)
coords = (10, 20)
locations = {coords: "home"}  # Works!
print(locations[(10, 20)])

# Can't do this with lists
# coords_list = [10, 20]
# locations = {coords_list: "home"}  # TypeError!

# Safety: tuple protects data
def process(data):
    # If data is a tuple, caller knows we won't modify it
    return sum(data)

result = process(t)
print(f"Sum: {result}, original unchanged: {t}")
```

The tuple uses 64 bytes vs list's 88 bytes. Tuple creation is noticeably faster. And the dict key usage is huge—lists just can't do that.

That hashability opens up whole patterns that lists can't handle.

## Gotchas

* **Speed advantage is small** — we're talking microseconds unless you're creating millions. Don't choose tuples only for speed.
* **Immutability is shallow** — if your tuple contains lists, those lists can still change. The tuple structure is frozen, not the contents.
* **Function defaults** — using `def func(items=())` (empty tuple) is safe. Using `def func(items=[])` (empty list) is a common bug because lists are mutable defaults.
