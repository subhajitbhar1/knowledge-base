# Can tuples have duplicates?

<!-- more -->

!!! info "In short"
    Yes, absolutely. Tuples don't care about uniqueness—they'll happily hold the same value multiple times. `(1, 2, 2, 3, 2)` is perfectly valid. That's different from sets, which automatically remove duplicates. Tuples preserve exactly what you put in, in the order you put it. This is useful when you're representing sequences where repetition matters: dice rolls, color histograms, database rows with repeated categories. If you need uniqueness, convert to a set. But tuples themselves? They allow and maintain duplicates just fine.

Tuples allow duplicate values without complaint.

Unlike sets (which enforce uniqueness), tuples keep every element you give them, even if some appear multiple times.

In the following example, we create tuples with duplicates and see how Python handles them:

```python
# Tuples with duplicates
numbers = (1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 4)
print(numbers)  # (1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 4)
print(numbers.count(2))  # 3

# Compare with a set (removes duplicates)
unique_numbers = set(numbers)
print(unique_numbers)  # {1, 2, 3, 4}

# Use case: color histogram
colors = ('red', 'blue', 'red', 'green', 'red')
print(f"Red appears {colors.count('red')} times")
```

The tuple preserves all three `2`s. The set collapses them into one. Converting to a set shows `{1, 2, 3, 4}` with duplicates gone.

That `.count()` method is handy when you need to know how many times something appears.

## Gotchas

* **Duplicates affect length** — `len((1, 1, 1))` is 3, not 1. Every element counts, even if they're the same value.
* **Sets vs tuples** — if you see duplicates and don't want them, use a set. Tuples won't automatically deduplicate for you.
* **Tuple as dict key** — you can use `(1, 2, 2)` as a dict key. But if you convert it to a list first, you can't (lists aren't hashable). Immutability matters.
