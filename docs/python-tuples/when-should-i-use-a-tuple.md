# When should I use a tuple?

<!-- more -->

!!! info "In short"
    Use tuples when: (1) the number of elements is fixed—coordinates, RGB values, date components, (2) you're returning multiple values from a function, (3) you need hashability for dict keys or set members, (4) you want immutability protection—config values, constants, or data passed between functions that shouldn't change. The decision is simple: if the structure is fixed and shouldn't grow/shrink, tuple. If it's a collection you'll modify, list. Tuples signal "this is a structure" while lists signal "this is a working collection."

Choose tuples when your data has a fixed structure.

Here are the clear use cases:

In the following example, we see situations where tuples are the right choice:

```python
# 1. Coordinates and geometric data
point_2d = (10, 20)
point_3d = (10, 20, 30)
bounding_box = (0, 0, 100, 100)  # x, y, width, height

# 2. Function returns
def calculate_stats(numbers):
    return (min(numbers), max(numbers), sum(numbers) / len(numbers))

min_val, max_val, avg = calculate_stats([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# 3. Dict keys (can't use lists!)
locations = {}
locations[(40.7128, -74.0060)] = "New York"
locations[(51.5074, -0.1278)] = "London"
print(locations[(40.7128, -74.0060)])

# 4. Constants and configuration
DATABASE_CONFIG = ("localhost", 5432, "myapp")
RGB_RED = (255, 0, 0)
DAYS_OF_WEEK = ("Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun")

# Can't accidentally modify
# DAYS_OF_WEEK.append("Funday")  # AttributeError!

# 5. Data integrity
def process_transaction(transaction):
    # transaction is a tuple - caller can't mess with it
    tx_id, amount, timestamp = transaction
    print(f"Processing transaction {tx_id}: ${amount}")

# Don't use tuple when you need to modify
# bad_list = (1, 2, 3)
# bad_list.append(4)  # Can't do this!

# Use list instead
good_list = [1, 2, 3]
good_list.append(4)  # This works
```

Each example shows fixed-structure data that benefits from immutability.

When in doubt: if it's a record or structure, use tuple. If it's a collection, use list.

## Gotchas

* **Don't overthink it** — tuples vs lists isn't a make-or-break decision. If you're not sure, start with a list. You can always convert.
* **Named tuples help** — for complex structures, `collections.namedtuple` gives field names: `Point(x=10, y=20)` instead of `(10, 20)`.
* **Tuples can contain mutables** — `t = ([1, 2], 3)` lets you modify the inner list. Immutability is shallow.
