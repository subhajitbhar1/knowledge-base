# Is a tuple just an array?

<!-- more -->

!!! info "In short"
    No. Tuples and arrays are fundamentally different. Tuples are Python's built-in immutable sequences—you can't change them after creation. Arrays (NumPy) are mutable, enforce uniform types, and are optimized for numerical computation with vectorized operations. Tuples accept mixed types: `(1, "hello", 3.14)`. Arrays typically hold one type for performance. Tuples have no math operations beyond basics. Arrays support matrix math, broadcasting, and scientific computing. Use tuples for general data structures. Use arrays for number crunching.

Tuples and arrays serve completely different purposes.

A tuple is a general-purpose immutable sequence. An array is a specialized container for numeric operations.

In the following example, we compare their characteristics:

```python
import numpy as np

# Tuple: immutable, mixed types
my_tuple = (1, "text", 3.14, [1, 2])
print(f"Tuple: {my_tuple}")
print(f"Type: {type(my_tuple)}")

# Can't modify
try:
    my_tuple[0] = 99
except TypeError as e:
    print(f"Tuple error: {e}")

# NumPy array: mutable, single type
my_array = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
print(f"\nArray: {my_array}")
print(f"Type: {type(my_array)}")
print(f"Dtype: {my_array.dtype}")

# CAN modify
my_array[0] = 99
print(f"Modified: {my_array}")

# Arrays support vectorized math
result = my_array * 2 + 10
print(f"Math: {result}")

# Tuples repeat when multiplied
tuple_result = my_tuple * 2
print(f"Tuple * 2: {tuple_result}")  # Concatenates, doesn't multiply elements
```

The tuple is mixed-type and immutable. The array is uniform-type (int64), mutable, and supports element-wise math. Multiplying a tuple repeats it; multiplying an array performs math on each element.

Completely different tools for different problems.

## Gotchas

* **Python's array module** — there's also `array.array` in the standard library, but it's less used than NumPy. Still mutable and typed, but no fancy math operations.
* **Tuples can contain arrays** — `t = (np.array([1, 2]), "data")` is valid. The tuple structure is frozen, but the array inside can be modified.
* **Performance context matters** — for a handful of values, tuple vs array makes no difference. For millions, arrays dominate for numeric work.
