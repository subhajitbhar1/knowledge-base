# Why might you choose to use a tuple instead of a list in Python?

<!-- more -->

!!! info "In short"
    Choose tuples when the data structure is fixed: coordinates `(x, y)`, RGB colors `(255, 0, 0)`, database records, configuration values, or function returns with multiple values. Tuples protect against accidental modification—you can't accidentally append to a coordinate or mutate a return value. They work as dict keys, so you can do `cache[(x, y)] = result`. And they signal intent to other developers: "this is a structure, not a collection." Lists are for dynamic collections you'll modify. Tuples are for fixed data you'll pass around.

Use tuples when you want immutability, either for safety or for technical requirements.

Here are the main scenarios where tuples shine:

In the following example, we see practical tuple use cases:

```python
# 1. Function returns (common pattern)
def get_user():
    return ("Alice", 30, "alice@example.com")

name, age, email = get_user()  # Clean unpacking
print(f"{name}, {age}")

# 2. Dict keys (tuples only)
# Cache function results by coordinates
cache = {}
cache[(10, 20)] = "expensive calculation result"
cache[(15, 25)] = "another result"
print(cache[(10, 20)])

# 3. Fixed structures (semantic clarity)
RED = (255, 0, 0)
GREEN = (0, 255, 0)
BLUE = (0, 0, 255)

def apply_color(color):
    # Function knows color won't mutate
    r, g, b = color
    return f"rgb({r}, {g}, {b})"

print(apply_color(RED))

# 4. Configuration (protect from accidental changes)
DB_CONFIG = ("localhost", 5432, "mydb")
host, port, dbname = DB_CONFIG

# Can't accidentally do DB_CONFIG.append("extra")
```

Each use case leverages immutability: returns don't get modified, cache keys don't change, colors stay constant, config is protected.

When structure is fixed, tuple is the natural choice.

## Gotchas

* **Don't overthink it** — if you're not sure, start with a list. You can always convert later. Premature optimization toward tuples is rarely needed.
* **Tuple unpacking is powerful** — `x, y = (10, 20)` is cleaner than `coords = (10, 20); x = coords[0]; y = coords[1]`. Use it.
* **Named tuples exist** — for complex structures, consider `collections.namedtuple` which gives field names: `Point(x=10, y=20)`.
