# What is a tuple vs array in Python?

<!-- more -->

!!! info "In short"
    Tuples are Python's built-in immutable sequences. Arrays (usually NumPy arrays) are mutable, typed, and optimized for numerical operations. Tuples accept mixed types `(1, "hello", 3.14)` and can't change. Arrays enforce one type (like all floats) and support vectorized math operations. Use tuples for general-purpose data grouping, multiple returns, dict keys. Use arrays for scientific computing, linear algebra, and when you need serious math performance. Plain Python doesn't have built-in arrays—you need NumPy or the array module for those.

Tuples and arrays serve different purposes with different trade-offs.

A tuple is a general-purpose immutable sequence. An array (NumPy) is a specialized mutable container for numeric computation.

In the following example, we compare tuples and NumPy arrays:

```python
import numpy as np

# Tuple: immutable, mixed types
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
print(my_tuple)
print(type(my_tuple))  # <class 'tuple'>

# NumPy array: mutable, single type, math-optimized
my_array = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(my_array)
print(type(my_array))  # <class 'numpy.ndarray'>

# Tuples can't do element-wise math
# result = my_tuple * 2  # Would give (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

# Arrays support vectorized operations
result = my_array * 2
print(result)  # [ 2  4  6  8 10]

# Tuples can't be modified
try:
    my_tuple[0] = 99
except TypeError as e:
    print(f"Tuple error: {e}")

# Arrays can
my_array[0] = 99
print(my_array)  # [99  2  3  4  5]
```

The tuple stays fixed. The array allows modification and supports fast math operations like `* 2` across all elements.

Arrays are all about performance for numerical work. Tuples are about general data structure immutability.

## Gotchas

* **Plain Python has array module** — Python's `array.array` exists for typed arrays, but NumPy is way more popular and powerful.
* **Memory layout** — NumPy arrays store data in contiguous memory blocks, making them cache-friendly. Tuples store pointers to objects.
* **Mixed types** — arrays usually enforce one type. Tuples let you mix: `(1, "text", 3.14)`. Different tools for different jobs.
