# Can you unpack a Python tuple?

<!-- more -->

!!! info "In short"
    Yes, and it's one of Python's most elegant features. Write `x, y, z = (1, 2, 3)` and each variable gets its value. Works with any iterable, not just tuples. Common uses: function returns `name, age = get_user()`, swapping `a, b = b, a`, ignoring values with `_`, or partial unpacking with `*rest`. Number of variables must match tuple length (or use `*` for variable-length). Unpacking makes code cleaner than indexing: compare `x, y = point` vs `x = point[0]; y = point[1]`. It's the Pythonic way.

Tuple unpacking assigns elements to multiple variables in one line.

It's syntactic sugar that makes code more readable.

In the following example, we see unpacking in action:

```python
# Basic unpacking
coordinates = (10, 20)
x, y = coordinates
print(f"x={x}, y={y}")

# Works without parentheses
a, b, c = 1, 2, 3
print(f"a={a}, b={b}, c={c}")

# Swapping variables (classic use)
x, y = 5, 10
x, y = y, x  # Elegant swap
print(f"After swap: x={x}, y={y}")

# Function returns
def get_user():
    return ("Alice", 30, "alice@example.com")

name, age, email = get_user()
print(f"{name}, {age}, {email}")

# Ignoring values with underscore
first, _, third = (1, 2, 3)
print(f"first={first}, third={third}")

# Extended unpacking with * (Python 3+)
first, *middle, last = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
print(f"first={first}, middle={middle}, last={last}")

# Must match length (or use *)
try:
    a, b = (1, 2, 3)  # Too many values
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

The basic form `x, y = (10, 20)` is clean and obvious. The swap `a, b = b, a` is Python magic. Extended unpacking with `*middle` captures variable-length sequences.

Unpacking is why tuples are perfect for function returns—you can destructure them immediately.

## Gotchas

* **Length must match** — `a, b = (1, 2, 3)` raises `ValueError: too many values to unpack`. Use `*` for variable-length.
* **Works on any iterable** — you can unpack lists, strings, ranges: `a, b, c = "abc"` works. Not tuple-specific.
* **Nested unpacking** — `(a, b), c = ((1, 2), 3)` works but gets hard to read. Keep it simple.
