# Is a tuple faster than an array?

<!-- more -->

!!! info "In short"
    Depends what you're doing. Tuples are faster to create (literal syntax) and iterate for small sequences. But NumPy arrays obliterate tuples for numerical operations—vectorized math, matrix operations, and statistical functions are 10-100x faster on arrays. Arrays store data in contiguous memory and use optimized C code. Tuples are generic Python objects. For coordinates or a few values? Tuple is fine. For thousands of numbers with math operations? Array wins by miles. Don't use tuples for numerical computation. That's what arrays (and NumPy) were built for.

Tuples and arrays are optimized for completely different workloads.

Tuples: fast creation, general-purpose. Arrays: numerical domination.

In the following example, we compare creation and computation:

```python
import timeit
import numpy as np

# Creation speed (tuples win)
tuple_create = timeit.timeit("(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)", number=1000000)
array_create = timeit.timeit(
    "np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])",
    setup="import numpy as np",
    number=1000000
)

print(f"Tuple creation: {tuple_create:.4f}s")
print(f"Array creation: {array_create:.4f}s")
print(f"Tuples are {array_create/tuple_create:.2f}x faster\n")

# Math operations (arrays destroy tuples)
my_tuple = tuple(range(10000))
my_array = np.array(range(10000))

# Tuple: need explicit loop
tuple_math = timeit.timeit(
    "tuple(x * 2 for x in t)",
    setup="t = tuple(range(10000))",
    number=1000
)

# Array: vectorized operation
array_math = timeit.timeit(
    "a * 2",
    setup="import numpy as np; a = np.array(range(10000))",
    number=1000
)

print(f"Tuple math: {tuple_math:.4f}s")
print(f"Array math: {array_math:.4f}s")
print(f"Arrays are {tuple_math/array_math:.2f}x faster for math")
```

Tuples create faster because `(1, 2, 3)` is a literal. Arrays need function calls and memory allocation. But for math? Arrays win massively because they're built for it.

Choose based on your workload, not generic "speed."

## Gotchas

* **Apples and oranges** — comparing tuple vs array is like comparing a screwdriver to a power drill. Different tools, different jobs.
* **Array overhead** — for 5 elements, the array overhead (imports, memory layout) might make tuples faster overall. For 10,000 elements with math, no contest.
* **Memory efficiency** — tuples store pointers to Python objects. Arrays store raw data in typed, contiguous memory. Arrays are way more memory-efficient for numbers.
