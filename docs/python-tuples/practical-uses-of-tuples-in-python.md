# What are the practical uses of tuples in Python?

<!-- more -->

!!! info "In short"
    Tuples excel at: (1) returning multiple values from functions cleanly, (2) serving as dict keys for caching/lookup tables, (3) representing database rows or CSV records, (4) storing coordinates and other geometric data, (5) function argument unpacking with `*args`, (6) protecting configuration data from modification, (7) swap variables in one line: `a, b = b, a`. The immutability makes them perfect for data that shouldn't change—you can pass tuples around confident they won't be mutated. And the hashability unlocks patterns lists can't handle, like using coordinate pairs as cache keys.

Tuples solve real problems in daily Python programming.

Here are the most common practical uses:

In the following example, we see tuples in action:

```python
# 1. Multiple return values (most common)
def get_stats(numbers):
    return (min(numbers), max(numbers), sum(numbers)/len(numbers))

min_val, max_val, avg = get_stats([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(f"Range: {min_val}-{max_val}, Average: {avg}")

# 2. Dict keys (caching, memoization)
fibonacci_cache = {}

def fib(n):
    if n in fibonacci_cache:
        return fibonacci_cache[n]
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    result = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
    fibonacci_cache[n] = result
    return result

# Can use tuples for multi-parameter keys
distance_cache = {}
distance_cache[(0, 0, 10, 10)] = 14.14  # from (0,0) to (10,10)

# 3. Immutable data structures
DAYS = ("Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun")
# Can't accidentally do DAYS.append("Funday")

# 4. Unpacking and swapping
a, b = 1, 2
a, b = b, a  # Elegant swap
print(f"After swap: a={a}, b={b}")

# 5. Database/CSV rows
rows = [
    (1, "Alice", "Engineering"),
    (2, "Bob", "Sales"),
    (3, "Carol", "Engineering")
]

for emp_id, name, dept in rows:
    print(f"{name} (ID: {emp_id}) - {dept}")

# 6. Function arguments with *args
def print_all(*args):  # args is a tuple
    print(f"Got {len(args)} arguments: {args}")

print_all(1, 2, 3, "four")
```

Each use leverages immutability, hashability, or clean unpacking syntax.

Tuples are workhorses for structured data.

## Gotchas

* **Returning None** — instead of returning multiple values where some might be None, consider returning a dict or named tuple for clarity.
* **Too many return values** — if you're returning 5+ values, that's a sign you need a class or at least a `namedtuple`.
* **Tuple performance** — for millions of tiny tuples, the immutability overhead is minimal. Don't avoid tuples for performance without measuring.
