Python's object instantiation expects <code>__init__</code> to return <code>None</code> immediately, not a coroutine.

Instead, use a factory pattern: define an async class method that creates the instance, then calls an async setup method. Or use <code>__await__</code> with <code>__new__</code> for advanced cases. The common pattern is <code>obj = await MyClass.create()</code>.

You can create and run multiple threads easily. However, the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) means only one thread executes Python bytecode at a time, so threads won't give you true parallelism for CPU-intensive work. Threads shine for I/O-bound tasks\u2014downloading files, making API calls, reading from disk\u2014because the GIL releases during I/O waits, letting other threads work. If you need real parallel computation, use <code>multiprocessing</code> instead.</p> <p>Here's a practical example of multithreading for I/O:</p> <pre><code>import threading\nimport time\n\ndef download_file(file_id):\n    print(f\"Downloading {file_id}...\")\n    time.sleep(2)  # Simulates I/O wait\n    print(f\"Downloaded {file_id}\")\n\n# Sequential approach\nstart = time.time()\nfor i in range(3):\n    download_file(i)\nprint(f\"Sequential: {time.time() - start:.2f}s\")  # ~6 seconds\n\n# Threaded approach\nstart = time.time()\nthreads = []\nfor i in range(3):\n    t = threading.Thread(target=download_file, args=(i,))\n    t.start()\n    threads.append(t)\n\nfor t in threads:\n    t.join()\nprint(f\"Threaded: {time.time() - start:.2f}s\")  # ~2 seconds\n</code></pre> <p>The threaded version is 3x faster because all downloads wait simultaneously. The GIL doesn't matter here\u2014threads are just waiting for I/O, not computing.</p> <p>Here's the catch: if your threads do heavy computation, the GIL forces them to take turns, and you gain nothing.

When you <code>await</code> something, your coroutine pauses and returns control to the event loop, which then runs other coroutines that are ready. Think of it like a juggler: the event loop keeps multiple balls (coroutines) in the air, giving each one attention when it's ready to move forward. When a coroutine hits <code>await</code> on I/O, it says \"I'm waiting, run someone else,\" and the loop switches to another task. This cooperative multitasking means tasks voluntarily yield\u2014no preemption, no threads.</p> <p>Here's a visualization of how the event loop switches between tasks:</p> <pre><code>import asyncio\nimport time\n\nasync def task(name, delay):\n    print(f\"[{time.time():.2f}] {name}: Started\")\n    await asyncio.sleep(delay)\n    print(f\"[{time.time():.2f}] {name}: Done\")\n\nasync def main():\n    await asyncio.gather(\n        task(\"Task-A\", 2),\n        task(\"Task-B\", 1),\n        task(\"Task-C\", 1.5)\n    )\n\nasyncio.run(main())\n</code></pre> <p>Output: <pre><code>[12.34] Task-A: Started\n[12.34] Task-B: Started\n[12.34] Task-C: Started\n[13.34] Task-B: Done\n[13.84] Task-C: Done\n[14.34] Task-A: Done\n</code></pre></p> <p>All tasks start immediately (they're queued), but the event loop interleaves them. Each <code>await</code> is a yield point where the loop can switch to another task. The loop keeps cycling through ready tasks until all are done.</p> <p>Here's the insight that clicks for most people: async isn't magic parallelism. It's organized waiting. The event loop doesn't make things faster\u2014it just prevents idle time from blocking everything else.</p>"},{"location":"python-async/how-async-works-in-python/#gotchas","title":"Gotchas","text":"<ul> <li>Blocking calls freeze everything \u2014 if you use <code>time.sleep()</code> or <code>requests.get()</code> in async code, the entire event loop stops.

You opt into async when you need it. Think of it like a car: Python normally drives in one lane (sync), but you can enable features for lane-switching (async) when traffic (I/O waits) makes it worthwhile. Most Python code is still synchronous, and that's perfectly fine for most use cases.</p> <p>Here's a comparison showing the difference:</p> <pre><code>import time\nimport asyncio\n\n# Synchronous Python (default)\ndef sync_task():\n    print(\"Sync start\")\n    time.sleep(1)\n    print(\"Sync done\")\n\nsync_task()  # Blocks for 1 second\n\n# Asynchronous Python (opt-in)\nasync def async_task():\n    print(\"Async start\")\n    await asyncio.sleep(1)\n    print(\"Async done\")\n\nasyncio.run(async_task())  # Can yield during sleep\n</code></pre> <p>Both take about 1 second, but the async version can let other tasks run during the <code>await asyncio.sleep(1)</code>. Synchronous Python waits; asynchronous Python cooperates.</p> <p>Here's what people often miss: Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) means only one thread executes Python bytecode at a time. Async isn't about parallelism\u2014it's about concurrency.

The syntax makes control flow obvious\u2014no more guessing where execution goes next. Use async/await when you need async I/O but want your code to remain readable.

Arrays typically hold one type for performance. Tuples have no math operations beyond basics. Arrays support matrix math, broadcasting, and scientific computing. Use tuples for general data structures. Use arrays for number crunching.</p> <p>Tuples and arrays serve completely different purposes.</p> <p>A tuple is a general-purpose immutable sequence. An array is a specialized container for numeric operations.</p> <p>In the following example, we compare their characteristics:</p> <pre><code>import numpy as np\n\n# Tuple: immutable, mixed types\nmy_tuple = (1, \"text\", 3.14, [1, 2])\nprint(f\"Tuple: {my_tuple}\")\nprint(f\"Type: {type(my_tuple)}\")\n\n# Can't modify\ntry:\n    my_tuple[0] = 99\nexcept TypeError as e:\n    print(f\"Tuple error: {e}\")\n\n# NumPy array: mutable, single type\nmy_array = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])\nprint(f\"\\nArray: {my_array}\")\nprint(f\"Type: {type(my_array)}\")\nprint(f\"Dtype: {my_array.dtype}\")\n\n# CAN modify\nmy_array[0] = 99\nprint(f\"Modified: {my_array}\")\n\n# Arrays support vectorized math\nresult = my_array * 2 + 10\nprint(f\"Math: {result}\")\n\n# Tuples repeat when multiplied\ntuple_result = my_tuple * 2\nprint(f\"Tuple * 2: {tuple_result}\")  # Concatenates, doesn't multiply elements\n</code></pre> <p>The tuple is mixed-type and immutable. The array is uniform-type (int64), mutable, and supports element-wise math. Multiplying a tuple repeats it; multiplying an array performs math on each element.</p> <p>Completely different tools for different problems.</p>"},{"location":"python-tuples/is-a-tuple-just-an-array/#gotchas","title":"Gotchas","text":"<ul> <li>Python's array module \u2014 there's also <code>array.array</code> in the standard library, but it's less used than NumPy.
